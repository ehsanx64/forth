# 4thlib

4thlib is my library of (portable) forth code.

As there any hundreds of Forth systems and each one, often include words that 
are missing in other systems, I need a form anti-corruption layer which is 
hopefully implemented by this library.

## Goals
- It should be easily included in multiple Forth systems without modifications

## Systems

- gforth
- pForth
- SwiftForth
- VFX Forth
- kforth
- 4th
- FICL
