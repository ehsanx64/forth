# 4thlib

4thlib is my library of (portable) forth code.

As there any hundreds of Forth systems and each one, often include words that 
are missing in other systems, I need a form anti-corruption layer which is 
hopefully implemented by this library.

## Goals
- It should be easily included in multiple Forth systems without modifications

## Systems

Forth systems which are complete and polished enough to be used as the base for
4thlib implementation. The list (ordered by priority and preference) is as
follows:

- gforth
- pForth
- SwiftForth
- VFX Forth
- kforth
- 4th
- FICL
